# LGB-methods
In this repository there are various implementations of the Linde, Buzo, and Gray algorithm (generalize Lloyd-Max algorithm) for the calculation of vector quantizer. In particular these are the algorithms implemented until now:

- [x] LGB
- [x] LGB-random
- [x] LGB-split

# Documentation

## LGB usage

To make this library work you must include this file.
```cpp
#include "LGB-methods/src/include.h"
using namespace LGBm;
```

First you need to initialize the quantizer.
```cpp
LGB<float> quantizer;
std::vector<float> signal = {1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0};
std::vector<std::vector<float>> initialPoints  = {{1, 0}, {2, 0}, {3, 0}, {4, 0}};
quantizer.rate = 1;
quantizer.nDimension = 2;
```

Then you can import the signal.
```cpp
quantizer.vectorize(signal);
```

In the end you can run the LGB algorithm and print the result.
```cpp
quantizer.run(initialPoints);
quantizer.printVectorPoints(quantizer.codebook);
```

## LGB-random usage

To make this library work you must include this file.
```cpp
#include "LGB-methods/src/include.h"
using namespace LGBm;
```

First you must initialize the quantizer.
```cpp
LGBrandom<float> quantizer;
std::vector<float> signal = {1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0};
std::vector<std::vector<float>> initialPoints  = {{1, 0}, {2, 0}, {3, 0}, {4, 0}};
quantizer.rate = 1;
quantizer.nDimension = 2;
```

Then you can import the signal.
```cpp
quantizer.vectorize(signal);
```

In the end you can run the LGB algorithm and print the result.
```cpp
quantizer.run();
quantizer.printVectorPoints(quantizer.codebook);
```

## LGB-split usage

To make this library work you must include this file.
```cpp
#include "LGB-methods/src/include.h"
using namespace LGBm;
```

First you must initialize the quantizer.
```cpp
LGBsplit<float> quantizer;
std::vector<float> signal = {1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0};
std::vector<std::vector<float>> initialPoints  = {{1, 0}, {2, 0}, {3, 0}, {4, 0}};
quantizer.rate = 1;
quantizer.nDimension = 2;
```

Then you can import the signal.
```cpp
quantizer.vectorize(signal);
```

In the end you can run the LGB algorithm and print the result.
```cpp
quantizer.run();
quantizer.printVectorPoints(quantizer.codebook);
```


## The LGB parameters

Here we have the parameters and theirs default values.
```cpp
// number of bit per sample
rate        = 2;

// the size of the vectors
nDimension  = 2;

// the maximum error allowed
threshold   = 0.01;

// max iteration limits
maxRuns     = 10;
maxZeroRuns = 5;
```
In addition for the LGB-split we have this parameter.
```cpp
// the size of the jump during the split
perturbation = 0.01;
```

## Exiting status for the run method

- **-2**: Generated a cluster with zero elements
- **-1**: Biggest cluster has zero size
- **+0**: Finish without reaching distortion or threshold limit
- **+1**: Stopped because distortion start increasing
- **+2**: Stopped because threshold reached
